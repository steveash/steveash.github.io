By day I am a Software Architect for ARGO Data.  I lead the "Skunkworks" R&D team.  We work on interesting problems in banking and health care using distributed systems, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and data mining.  

Here are some problems that I've worked on:

* Determining if two medical records refer to the same real world person using tons of data mined reference information (about names, cultures, phonetics), a bajillion heuristics, and some fancy math. This is running in production in numerous health care facilities in Texas, Oklahoma, New York, and California.
* Building a better address parser using modern machine learning and NLP (patented).
* Detecting check fraud in banking transactions. This is running in production in a number of banks in the United States and Canada.
* Scalable machine learning using Spark Streaming + Cassandra
* String similarity measurement and clustering at scale (patented).
* Moving tens of millions of check images across the top 50 banks in the US every night.
* Doing all of the above at high throughput and low latency in distributed clusters of machines.
* A number of nitty gritty integration libraries for various IPC and RPC scenerios: marshalling between platforms like C# + JVM stuff, etc.


### Technology

* **Language expertise**: Java, Groovy, Python, C#/.NET, C/C++, SQL
* **Infrastructure**: Spark, Spark Streaming, Hadoop, ELK, Elasticsearch, Docker
* **Storage**: Cassandra, GridGain/Ignite, HDFS, Kafka, MSSQL, Postgres, Oracle
* **Data Mining, Machine Learning**: KNIME, Weka, Mallet, scikit-learn, Factorie, NLTK, Deeplearning4j

### Education

* **PhD, Computer Science**. University of Memphis. 2017.
* **MS, Computer Science**. University of Memphis. 2012.
* **BA, Computer Science**. Rhodes College. 2006.

My academic background covers a wide range of computer science topics:

* low level database work -- enhancing database query optimizers and storage subsystems for SSDs
* distributed systems -- implementing 2 phase commit protocols in a distributed hash table system
* challenging NLP problems -- grapheme to phoneme transduction in multiple languages using probabilistic graphical models
* similarity problems -- using probabilistic models and a complicated data pipelines to do large scale demographic matching, improving the state of the art
