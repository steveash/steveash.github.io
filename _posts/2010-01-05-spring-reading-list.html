Wow...I really haven't posted regularly, have I?  I'd like to catalog some things for my own reference, and to come back in years and chuckle at my musings and naivet√©.  This leads naturally into a topic: knowledge and learning.<br /><br />I am an avid reader.  I don't really enjoy much fiction, but I love computer science and technology books.  I have a bit of an ...erm... addiction (some would say) to Amazon Marketplace.  If we take a trip in the 'way back' machine to 2001ish, we will see a younger (still in High School) Steve, delighted to receive his first Amazon Marketplace shipment: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Visual-Basic-Techniques-Everyday/dp/0201707128/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1267134110&amp;sr=8-1">Advanced Visual Basic 6: Power Techniques for Everyday Programs</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Visual-Basic-Improve-Applications/dp/0201704765/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1267134093&amp;sr=8-2">Effective Visual Basic: How to Improve your VB/COM+ Applications</a>.  <i>Once you have stopped laughing at the thought of "Effective" or "Advanced" Visual Basic, please continue</i><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_CNfYytZgqGU/S4b6FLkEPiI/AAAAAAAAAAw/f1QVEmo0OVs/s1600-h/IMAGE_165.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: both; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_CNfYytZgqGU/S4b6FLkEPiI/AAAAAAAAAAw/f1QVEmo0OVs/s320/IMAGE_165.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5442312166634176034" border="0" /></a><br />Here are two of my bookshelves now.  I can't honestly claim that I have read all of them cover to cover, but I always read at least a few chapters of each, and note which sections I want to come back to.  Many, though, I have read all the way through-- for example, if you haven't read Brian Goetz's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Java-Concurrency-Practice-Brian-Goetz/dp/0321349601/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1267134676&amp;sr=8-1">Java Concurrency in Practice</a>, then you are missing out!<br /><br />Here are some of my favorite books:<br /><br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-2nd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683/ref=pd_sim_b_1">Effective Java</a> by Josh Bloch.  A collection of pragmatic patterns, and more importantly sound reasoning as to <i>why</i> they are recommended.</li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Java-Concurrency-Practice-Brian-Goetz/dp/0321349601/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1267134676&amp;sr=8-1">Java Concurrency in Practice</a> - excellent overview of the two most important aspects of multi-threaded programming: memory consistency and mutual exclusion.  People seem to forget about the first one.  Once you finish this book, please go read William Pugh's information on <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/%7Epugh/java/memoryModel/index.html">JSR 133</a>.  After that if you still don't understand what <b>volatile</b> <i>really</i> is, then repeat.</li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321413091/ref=oss_product">Implementation Patterns</a> by Kent Beck. He describes the book as a companion to Fowler's canoncial "Refactoring" text.  Implementation Patterns focuses on the 'small' decisions that we make every day as it pertains to design, code organization, and getting all of the '-ilities' working for us.  Reading this was like re-living the first few years of professional Java development-- Kent just did a good job 'formalizing' a vocubulary with which to discuss and evaluate these various 'design pressures' that enter our mind as we code.</li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0557078326/ref=oss_product">Real World Java EE Patterns</a> by JEE guru Adam Bien.  I found this book wonderful.  In particular, his trade off analysis that accompanies each pattern is an excellent way to learn how he reasons about design.<br /></li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/020161622X/ref=oss_product">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> - this is a famous book and certainly worth the read.  I think it's a good litmus test for oneself.  I read this once before I started my career and found that I <i>learned</i> a ton.  I thought all of the little gems of advice were new and useful.  I re-read (or skimmed) this recently, and found myself going "yep, I remember learning that the hard way".  I kind of view this as a way to guage the efficiency of the environment within which you work.  I have been lucky to work in an environment that properly incentivized writing good software.  Thus, I learned these lessons quickly and efficiently as part of my day to day work.  If you work in a lazy environment, you may never learn these lessons.</li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596510047/ref=oss_product">Beautiful Code</a> - this collection of essays is a great read.  It's goal (and it succeeds) is imparting <i>how</i> great developers think.  These lessons help 'shape' the way in which we approach problem solving.  The entire "Beautiful" series is wonderful.  I have read them all, except the new "Beautiful Security".</li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Java-Generics-Collections-Maurice-Naftalin/dp/0596527756/ref=pd_sim_b_2">Java Generics</a> - I am not recommending this book, unless you are (a) curious about some of the 'exotic' features of generics, (b) enjoy the theoretical aspects of language design (reification, contra/covariance, etc.) , or (c) want to understand the reasoning behind the design decisions that were made by the expert group.</li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430219025/ref=oss_product">SQL Server 2008 Query Performance Distilled</a> - this is my favorite pick for SQL Server optimization.  Of course Delaney's Inside SQL volume on the matter is great too, but <i>Distilled</i> is a little bit more bang for your buck.  I found more useful information crammed into a smaller text.  Once you read this (and all of the Inside SQL Server series) then you can graduate to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/craigfr/">Craig Freedman's Blog</a><br /></li></ul>Whew... well I know I am forgetting some.  I should probably edit this later after I return home to check any that I may have missed.  Another neat fact I learned in doing this is that I have had 137 separate orders with Amazon since 2004... most of which had multiple books :/  I need to seek group help or something...<br /><br />Steve
