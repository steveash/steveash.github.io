I'm giving a talk to the local <a href="http://www.meetup.com/memphis-technology-user-groups/events/223473111/">Data Science / Machine Learning meetup</a>. The topic is a shallow tour of data science topics including tasks and methods. This is a new group and many of the attendees do not have a data science background but are interested.  Therefore, <!--more-->I thought a talk that went through the highlights would be useful. Not only is the tour a whirlwind, but creating the slides was a bit of a rush job in the wee hours of the night, so please excuse typos, factual errors, slander, blatent malicious lies, etc. <br/><br/>Presentation is: <a href="http://slides.com/steveash/datascience/">http://slides.com/steveash/datascience/</a>
