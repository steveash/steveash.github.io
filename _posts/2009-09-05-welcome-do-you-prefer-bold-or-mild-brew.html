Hello,<br /><br />My name is Steve.  I am currently an enterpise Java developer in a high volume transaction processing oriented domain.  We do a lot of 'batch' workloads, and so my day is filled with lots of interesting challenges.  I hope to catalogue some of these challenges here, and if I'm lucky, some more learned individuals on the internets will contribute.  My current interests are:<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>High volume, batch oriented, mixed workloads and how such workloads scale using traditional (DBMS) and non-traditional (grid, extreme transaction processing) architectures.<br /></li><br /><li>Database technology, specifically implementation with regards to concurrency</li><br /><li>Distributed computing including caching and data grids, computing grids, partitioning approaches, etc.</li><br /><li>Problem solving, cognitive calisthenics, intelligence and learning.  Obviously, these are very important topics in Computer Science.  I am interested in these primarily in how they relate to developer productivity, but also am interested in them in the AI domain.</li><br /><li>Economics of software engineering.  This includes SDLC processes, but currently focused on how teams and processes scale given specialization, project size, etc.</li><br /></ul><br /><br />I feel like I am not doing a good job describing my interests. :-(  I, like most, have a lot of them!<br /><br />I know that this is just a metaphorical 'drop in the bucket' of technology blogs, but I am going to try to blog about things that I haven't seen on other blogs.  This is spurious from the start, because obviously, I have only read a tiny subset of existing blogs... but I'll give it a go, none the less.<br /><br />Upcoming topics (these first are very database centric):<br /><br />- SQL Server deadlock hell (or how I learned to stop worrying and love the lock)<br />- Fragmentation, Batch Inserts, and Primary Keys...oh my!<br /><br />Steve
