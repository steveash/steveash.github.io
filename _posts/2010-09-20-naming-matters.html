This title is kind of a two-for: "Naming matters" as in matters pertaining to naming and naming <i>matters</i> as gee golly-- names really do make a difference!  So hurray for homonyms and making a neat opening to what is likely to be a boring post :-)  (Have I hooked you to read further? dratz...)<br /><br />API design "theory" is curious, because it seems to take a back seat in the academic literature, and yet the economic impact of bad API design is so great to the "problem" of software development.  I guess the Software Engineering folk are fighting the good fight with code quality metrics, etc., but this is a hard topic, that I had never considered throughout my entire undergraduate career.<br /><br />Here's an example of an API design mistake in my opinion (albeit a simple one).  In Java, there are the following constants defined:<br /><ul><li><b>Integer.MIN_VALUE</b></li><li><b>Long.MIN_VALUE</b></li><li>etc.</li></ul><br />These define the lowest value that can be represented by this datatype.  Thus, for example, <b>Integer.MIN_VALUE</b> is -2147483648 given that its 4 bytes and uses a 2-s complement representation, etc.<br /><br />These are used all over the place as sentinels.  For example, a typical implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm initializes every node to a shortest distance of <b>Integer.MAX_VALUE</b>, and as the algorithm progresses, any value will (likely) be less than MAX_VALUE.  Thus, it's a natural way to construct the algorithm without having to code a bunch of fragile "special cases" (adding to your cyclomatic complexity).<br /><br />So what do you think <b>Double.MIN_VALUE</b> returns?<br /><br />Well as a bug that I coded last week demonstrates, it does *not* return the minimum value of the range of values that can be represented in an instance of the Double data type.  That would be <i>ludicrous</i> (this is me being sarcastic).<br /><br />No, instead it returns the smallest <i>positive</i> value.  You need to use <b>Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY</b> for the smallest, *cough* <i>minimum</i> *cough* value.<br /><br />Note that in C#/.NET Double.MinValue is the <i>minimum</i> value (i.e. negative number).  I wonder what it is in limits.h...<br /><br />So what's up Java?!  I wonder how many man hours of time have been wasted on this pitfall since Java's inception?  Can we ask Guy Steel and Bill Joy for a check?  Just kidding... <br /><br />Steve
