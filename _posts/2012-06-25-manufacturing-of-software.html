<p>Among non-technologists, I think there is a common belief -- a wishful thought-- that building software is like any manufacturing process.  You just need to design the process, and then get the widgets on the assembly line to execute the process-- and viola! If a widget quits, you just buy a new widget at <!--more--><strike>the widget store</strike> Monster.com. </p><p>Thankfully, most of the truly remarkable software projects and software teams over the last decade have debunked this myth and shown the lie.  The agile manifesto itself states to value <i>people</i> over <i>processes</i> and this is really a statement against this manufacturing projection. </p><p>I ran across this wonderful quote while reading Eric Evan's Domain Driven Design: </p><blockquote>Manufacturing is a popular metaphor for software development.  One inference from this metaphor: highly skilled engineers design; less skilled laborers assemble the products.  This metaphor has messed up a lot of projects for one simple reason -- software development is <i>all</i> design. </blockquote>
