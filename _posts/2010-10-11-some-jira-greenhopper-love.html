This will be another brief, non-technical, un-informative post to rant..but in a positive way! I actually will post something informative and useful one day ;-)<br /><br />A team member and I have been using JIRA and recently started using the GreenHopper plug-in.  The plug-in advertises that it is "agile" focused. <!--more--> I have always been extremely satisfied with Atlassian products, but this is something special.  They really have done a great job in usability with GreenHopper.<br /><ul><li>The "boards" present a nice, intuitive, usable visualization of a part of the project.  <li>Every aspect of the "boards" visualization (color coding, progress bars, in-place editing) reinforces with high affordance the functionality of that view.</li><li>The tools gets out of the way as much as possible in terms of navigation and functionality. Its intuitive. I find that I spend 95% of my time just on the Task board. I never need to leave.</li><li>Using the "boards" is fun!</li></ul><br /><br />For example, from the "task" board, I can open bugs, assign them to other people, begin progress, etc.  This is my "specialized" view that I, a developer, use to see my tasks and at-a-glance get a view of the whole sprint.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_CNfYytZgqGU/TLOHxxL3X4I/AAAAAAAAABA/h-jKYdgGqL8/s1600/jira1.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 234px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_CNfYytZgqGU/TLOHxxL3X4I/AAAAAAAAABA/h-jKYdgGqL8/s400/jira1.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5526910456800173954" /></a><br /><br />Here are some noteworthy features of this visualization:<br /><ul><li>There are three columns for this sprint: To Do, In Progress, Done.  You just drag a card between the columns to start progress or resolve as done.  Just as you would with a card on a cork board (intuitive metaphor).</li><li>You can switch projects and sprints/versions by clicking the down arrows next in the headers</li><li>You can add bugs, features, etc. for this sprint just by clicking the button for that issue (right under the filter icon).</li><li>You can add comments to the issue simply or bring up a light box with the entire JIRA issue (see below).</li><li>There is a nice progress bar that shows the overall progress for the entire sprint.</li></ul><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_CNfYytZgqGU/TLOLHgACiUI/AAAAAAAAABI/mM7X25vgB5o/s1600/jira2.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 222px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_CNfYytZgqGU/TLOLHgACiUI/AAAAAAAAABI/mM7X25vgB5o/s400/jira2.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5526914128679176514" /></a><br /><br />When a new sprint comes around you can check out the "planning" board, where you can drag and drop cards to different releases or sprints.  Also, there is a "chart" board which summarizes various charts (burndown rate, etc.), and a "released" board which provides metrics on completed sprints and releases.<br /><br />This is just a little bit of why I like GreenHopper.  I have just been so pleased with it that I wanted to share.  I have used bugzilla, plain JIRA, and Team Foundation in the past.  Team Foundation I know has much of the same (if not more) reporting than GreenHopper, but I never saw a visualization for me, the developer, that was as useful (defined by power/weight ratio) as what GreenHopper provides in the Planning Boards.  Its the subtle simplicity and usability that I think makes GreenHopper so great-- not just sheer functionality.<br /><br />If anyone actually reads this I would be interested to hear others' opinions about tools-- in particular other "killer features" like GreenHoppers planning boards.<br /><br />Steve
