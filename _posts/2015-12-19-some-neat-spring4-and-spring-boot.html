Here's a few slides on some of the Spring4 and Spring Boot features that I used on a recent project that are interesting.

But in case anyone else has any interest: <p/><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Dlamdl868CXAh301rH-AI0ugaWCUqv_ld6Eu9TvPX_A/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000" frameborder="0" width="480" height="389" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
