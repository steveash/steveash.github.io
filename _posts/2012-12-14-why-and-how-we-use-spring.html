We brought on some new team members recently and I couldn't find a good intro to Spring that went through the motivation of why one might use Spring. &nbsp;Thus, I created this presentation. &nbsp;Don't know if anyone else will find it valuable:<br /><br />I wanted something that went through the trade-off discussion of various options for dependency management (serivce locator, dependency injection) and then showed some practical uses of Spring and mentioned some pitfalls that I've encountered.  This was meant to be a practical onboarding to the technology of Spring in Java. <br /><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/embed?id=1_B68o-1_FYE422bGYzqHqhEJnP532IbxPmWjNgHvKY4&start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000" frameborder="0" width="480" height="389" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe> Steve
