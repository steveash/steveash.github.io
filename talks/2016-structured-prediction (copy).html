# What is Structured Prediction

Common machine learning tasks:
* _Classification_: input data to fixed number of output classes/categories
   * Is this credit card transaction fraudulent?
   * Does this patient have liver disease?
* _Regression_: input data to continuous output
   * Prospective student's future GPA based on information from his/her college application

What about classification over a _sequence_ of information?
