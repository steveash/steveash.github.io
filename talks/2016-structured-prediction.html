### Agenda

* What is Structured Prediction?
* **Act 1**: How to solve this problem in 1996? 
    * _generative models_

* **Act 2**: How to solve this problem in 2006? 
    * _discriminative models_

* **Act 3**: How to solve this problem in 2016?
    * _recurrent neural networks_

### What is Structured Prediction

Common machine learning tasks:
* **Classification**: input data to fixed number of output classes/categories
   * Is this credit card transaction fraudulent?
   * Does this patient have liver disease?

* **Regression**: input data to continuous output
   * Prospective student's future GPA based on information from his/her college application

What about classification over a _sequence_ of information?

### What is Structured Prediction

Assign part-of-speech tags to sequence of words: 

"Steve plays piano sometimes"

### What is Structured Prediction

The sequence of words &mdash; i.e. the _structure_ &mdash; affects the part-of-speech. We need to incorporate this structure into the predictive method that we want to use in order to improve our accuracy. 

Without the structure we can't disambiguate words that have more than one part-of-speech:

> "Will Bob will the will to Will?"

# Act 1
Generative Models
</section>

<section data-markdown>
### Generative Models 
In the part-of-speech example given previously, we had a sequence of words and a seqence of POS tags.

* `$X_t$` = the word at time `$t$` 
* `$Y_t$` = the predicted POS tag at time `$t$`

In probabilistic modelling we model our inputs and outputs as _random variables_. In this case the random variable `$X_t$` is a _categorical_ variable that takes as its value any one of the words in the english language.
