  <p>I'm going to (slowly) migrate things over to this site, but the original posts are all still in Blogger. I ran the import to bring them over, but haven't spent the time to update the content to make sure that it appears correctly.  So maybe check out the <a href="//blog.manycupsofcoffee.com">original blogger site</a> for the time being.</p>

  <ul class="post-list">
    <li>
      <a href="{{ "/assets/2016-structured-prediction.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Structured Prediction in 3 Acts</a>
      <p>A post discussing 3 methods to solve simple structured prediction problems in historical order. Covers HMMs, CRFs, and LSTMs</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
